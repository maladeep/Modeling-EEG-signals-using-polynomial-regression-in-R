## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of modeling EEG signals using polynomial regression. The code and analysis is done using R and the detailed interpretation of the results is presented in an R Markdown file.

## Introduction to EEG signals?

EEG stands for Electroencephalogram which are electrical signals that measured the electrical activity of the brain (St et al., 2016). 
To get the EEG result, electrodes consisting of small metal discs with thin wires are pasted onto scalp. The electrodes detect tiny electrical charges that result from the activity of your brain cells and thus obtained charges are amplified and appear as a graph on a computer screen, or as a recording that may be printed out on paper. 
The main purpose of EEG is to detect potential problems (encephalitis, hemorrhage, epilepsy,Parkinson's disease and other) with brain cell communication by painless method (Healthline, 2012).

Here in the data set, we have four input EEG signals, one output signals and time for each signals.


## After understanding and working with this notebook, you will be able to do:

1. Visualize the trend and patterns in the EEG signals over time.
2. Assess the fit of the polynomial regression model to the EEG signals and estimate the parameters of the model.
3. Use a simulation-based approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, allowing for uncertainty in the model and data..
ion-based approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, allowing for uncertainty in the model and data.
